       <h2>Photgraphy Drones</h2>
          <h4>Consumer Level</h4>
         <p>Photography drones are quadcopters that are used to take pictures and videos.  These drones are becoming more and more common as the drones become easier to manage.  There are many companies that manufacture consumer level drones including DJI, Yuneec, and many more.  These companies produce quality drones that can be flown by the average person.  Many photography companies use drones to film weddings and other special events.  They use drones because of the special perspective that they capture.  The technology that photography drones have is amazing.  For example, the higher end consumer level drones can fly around 3 miles away while streaming video back to the pilot's phone.  These drones also use gps to make the flight even easier because the drone will hold its position when you let off the thumb sticks on the controller.  </p>
          <h4>Professional Level</h4>
          <p>Professional level drone often have many of the same features as consumer level drones.  Professional level drones have gps, camera stabilization, return to home, etc just like many consumer level drones.  The main difference between the two types of drones is the quality of camera.  Professional level drones usually have a large payload capacity so the camera can be whatever the photographer wants and not just the stock camera resulting in superior photo quality.  Finally, because of the ability to accomodate other cameras, professional drones are much larger with payload capacitys of up to 10 lbs!  Professional level drones are much, much more expensive...some are up to $30,000 but not all of them are that expensive.  The DJI Inspire 1 and Inspire 2 are between $2,000 and $3,000 but still offer some amazing features.  </p>
