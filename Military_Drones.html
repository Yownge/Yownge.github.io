             <h2>Military Drones</h2>
         <p>Military drones are used in situations where an unmanned aircraft is beneficial because of the riskiness of the mission.   These drones can be equiped with cameras, missiles, sensors, and many other devices. Military drones are a safer alternative to traditional flights that risk the pilot's life.  Military drones come in all shapes and sizes including reconaissance drones, border patrol drones, combat drones, etc.

              <h3>Reconaissance</h3>
          <p>Reconaissance drones are very important in the military.  These drones don't risk a life and can survey an area so that military leaders can formulate a battle plan.  Reconaissance drones are also very usful because of their ability to asses damages.  These drones can asses damages of enemies or allies without risking a life.  Reconaissance drones can be equiped with many sensors and cameras such as thermal cameras and electro-optic sensors as well as a laser range finder.  These drones can also carry cameras with programs that can find mines or roadside bombs by using an extremly complex algorithm.    </p>

              <h3>Combat</h3>
          <p>Drones are a major asset for military combat mission.  These drones can carry missiles, bombs, etc.  The drones are controlled from a control station that can be anywhere because the operator and the drone are both connected to satelites.  These drones are used in the military now but they arent perfected yet.  They still crash quite often and require a lot of maintenance.  Drones are the future of warfare though and they will become better and better over time.  </p>
