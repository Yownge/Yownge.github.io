         <h2> What are Drones? </h2>
         <p>Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles.  There are many types of drones including photography, delivery, military and many more. </p>
         <h2>Photography Drones</h2>
         <p>Photography drones are quadcopters that are used to take pictures and videos.  These drones are becoming more and more common as the drones become easier to manage.  There are many companies that manufacture consumer level drones including DJI, Yuneec, and many more.  These companies produce quality drones that can be flown by the average person.  Many photography companies use drones to film weddings and other special events.  They use drones because of the special perspective that they capture.  The technology that photography drones have is amazing.  For example, the higher end consumer level drones can fly around 3 miles away while streaming video back to the pilot's phone.  These drones also use gps to make the flight even easier because the drone will hold its position when you let off the thumb sticks on the controller.  </p>
         <h2>Military Drones</h2>
         <p>Military drones are used in situations where an unmanned aircraft is beneficial because of the riskiness of the mission.   These drones can be equiped with cameras, missiles, sensors, and many other devices. Military drones are a safer alternative to traditional flights that risk the pilot's life.  Military drones come in all shapes and sizes including unmanned planes with missiles, bird like drones that have wings and look like a normal bird, and unmanned helicopters for fire fighting, border control, reconaissance, etc.
