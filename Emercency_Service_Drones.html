             <h2>Emercency Service Drones</h2>
          <p>Recently drones have been being used in many more ways than ever thought possible.  Drones are now used for firefighting, law enforcement, and search and rescue. Drones are very efficient in emergency situations becuase of their portability and ability to fly over dangerous areas.  The only downside of using drones is the difficulty of getting licensing because of the fear from the general public and Washington about the invasion of privacy</p>

              <h4>Firefighting Drones</h4>
          <p>Drones can be used in firefighting so that the firefighters can see the hottest parts of the fire by using a thermal camera on the drone.  This is very important so that firefighters can target the hottest part of the fire.  This can be especially helpful in bigger fires where the hottest part of the fire needs to be taken out first.  Firefighters can also use drones to locate people caught in the fire which is extremely important.  Finally, firefighters can evaluate air quality and falling debris so that firefighters can enter the building or area safely.  BUT REMEMBER, NEVER FLY DRONES OVER FOREST FIRES. This is dangerous because it can interfere with firefighting efforts by other firefighting aircraft such as planes and helicopters.  Only firefighters can fly over forest fires.</p>

                <h4>Law Enforement</h4>
          <p>  Police officers can use drones to try to find suspects using thermal cameras because flying a drone doesn't have too much setup time and it is much faster than chasing a suspect on foot.  Thermal Cameras are also good for finding the suspect if they run in the woods for example.  There are drones right now being developed that can shoot nonlethal weapons such as rubber bullets, tazers, tear gas, etc.  These drone will have an extremely hard time getting licensing but they could be part of the police force in the future.  North Dakota has already passed a law allowing drones to use nonlethal weapons.

             <h4>Search and Rescue</h4>
          <p>Drones are used for search and rescue efforts especially in wooded and/or mountainous areas.  These drones are sometimes equiped with thermal cameras so that it is easier to spot the person even if they arent moving around.  Drones are much better at finding lost people than normal search teams because of the perspective they gain.  From the air, many clues are much easier to see such as tiretracks, knocked down foliage, etc.  Sometimes searchers can be mere feet away from the missing person and not realize because of the dense foliage.  A drone on the otherhand can look straight down and spot the missing person easily.  Drones can also survey an area much quicker than searchers on foot.</p>
