       <h2>Emercency Service Drones</h2>
          <p>Recently drones have been being used in many more ways than ever thought possible.  Drones are now used for firefighting, law enforcement, and search and rescue.  The Inspire 1 is also cost effective as it is around $2,500 which isnt too bad for the functions of a quality drone like the Inspire.</p>  
              <h4>Firefighting Drones</h4>
          <p>Drones can be used in firefighting so that the firefighters can see the hottest parts of the fire by using a thermal camera on the drone.  This can be especially helpful in forest fires and larger scale fires.  BUT REMEMBER, NEVER FLY DRONES OVER FOREST FIRES. This is dangerous because it can interfere with firefighting efforts.  Only firefighters can fly over forest fires.</p>
              <h4>Law Enforement</h4>
          <p>  Police officers can use drones to try to find suspects using thermal cameras because flying a drone doesn't have too much setup time and it is much faster than chasing a suspect on foot.  Thermal Cameras are also good for finding the suspect if they run in the woods for example. 
          </p>
          <h4>Search and Rescue</h4>
          <p>Drones are used for search and rescue efforts especially in wooded and/or mountainous areas.  These drones are equiped with thermal cameras so that it is easier to spot the person even if they arent moving around. </p>
